I am a data scientist and former researcher in music cognition and empirical aesthetics. This is my personal blog where I write about data science projects, mostly focussing on music. The blog was build in R using [blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown), which provides an easy way to host static websites based on R markdown and Hugo. The website uses the [Hugo Nuo Theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-nuo/).
