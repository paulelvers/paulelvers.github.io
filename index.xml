      <description>Hi ðŸ‘‹. I am Paul. I am a data scientist/ml-engineer.
I build recommender systems and ml-models in the digital advertising space for Tchibo, one of Germany&amp;rsquo;s biggest online retailers. Currently I am working at Smartclip, Europes lading adtech and video ad monetisation solution.
Previously, I was a doctoral student and research fellow at MPI-EA, where I learned a lot about data &amp;amp; statistical modeling, build a model of musical self-enhancement (see my publications) and measured risk-taking behaviour in response to musical stimuli (see paper).</description>

      <description>Pandas is undoubtedly one of the most important Python libraries in data science and machine learning. Many practitioners in the field are using it on a daily basis. But even as an experienced user, you might have been puzzled by this warning: SettingWithCopyWarning. A value is trying to be set on a copy of a slice from a DataFrame. Try using .loc[row_indexer,col_indexer] = value instead.
It could be tempting to just ignore it, especially when the code does what you wanted.</description>
