      <description>Clustering is an important tool in data science that allows detecting similarities of objects in a data set. It is not one algorithm but describes a family of algorithms that seeks to identify objects that closely resemble each other. From a given set of features, a measure of proximity for each object of a data set is derived. Objects are then clustered based on the distance measure. The analysis yields &amp;ldquo;clusters&amp;rdquo; (groups or types of things) that share a unique set of features and distinguish the objects from those in other clusters.</description>
