      <description>I apply data science tools to learn about people’s behavior,
currently at Goldmsiths, University of London and University of Hamburg.
Before I was research fellow at Max Planck Institute for Empirical Aesthetics and
visiting researcher at University of Oxford.

      <description>Clustering is an important data mining tool for statistics and machine learning. It belongs to the class of unsupervised learning algorithms and its main function is to group together objects that share similar features into clusters. Here I present a short demonstration of how a clustering algorithm can be applied in R and what it may be used for. To this end, I present a real use case from a research project on musical taste I conducted at the Max Planck Institute for Empirical Aesthetics.</description>
