      <description>I still experience a moment of excitement, whenever I start on a new ml project and look at my prediction results for the first time, not sure whether this will be a good model or just garbage. I am not talking about metrics, but just about the actual prediction outputs. There is this thing that so many people working with algorithms may now take for granted, that actually sometimes touches me in this particular moment, when the predictions do &amp;lsquo;make sense&amp;rsquo;: A machine actually learned to produce something meaningful.</description>

      <description>Hi ðŸ‘‹. I am Paul. I am a data scientist/ml-engineer.
I am working at Smartclip, Europe&amp;rsquo;s leading adtech and video ad monetisation solution. Previously, I built recommender systems and ml-models in the digital advertising space for Tchibo, one of Germany&amp;rsquo;s biggest online retailers.
I was a doctoral student and research fellow at MPI-EA, where I learned a lot about data &amp;amp; statistical modeling, built a model of musical self-enhancement (see my publications) and measured risk-taking behaviour in response to musical stimuli (see paper).</description>

      <title>SettingWithCopyWarning</title>

      <description>Pandas is undoubtedly one of the most important Python libraries in data science and machine learning. Many practitioners in the field are using it on a daily basis. But even as an experienced user, you might have been puzzled by this warning: SettingWithCopyWarning. A value is trying to be set on a copy of a slice from a DataFrame. Try using .loc[row_indexer,col_indexer] = value instead.
It could be tempting to just ignore it, especially when the code does what you wanted.</description>
