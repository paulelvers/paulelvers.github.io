      <description>Pandas is undoubtedly one of the most important Python libraries in data science and machine learning. Many practitioners in the field are using it on a daily basis. But even as an experienced user, you might have been puzzled by this warning: SettingWithCopyWarning. A value is trying to be set on a copy of a slice from a DataFrame. Try using .loc[row_indexer,col_indexer] = value instead.
It could be tempting to just ignore it, especially when the code does what you wanted.</description>
